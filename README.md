Paraphore mods are .txt files written in the Haxe language.

Start by peeking at modText.txt to see the most basic possible mod structure.

If you want to include custom assets in your mod, you'll have to pack your .txt mod file and all your assets into a .tar archive. A good tool for that is 7-zip, available here: http://www.7-zip.org/

Peek at silverwing7z.txt to check out a fan-made mod with its own custom art, by silverwing7z!

That big mess of numbers and letters at the start is all the custom .pngs converted into text form. To do the same with your art, put them through a base64 converter like this one: https://www.base64-image.de/
